		<h2>Short Bio and filmografy</h2>
		<p>
			After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Young blood (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, <q>River's Edge </q> (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated  Dangerous Liaisons (1988) with director Stephen Frears.

		<p>
			His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude "Ted Logan" in <q>Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure</q> (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard's comedy, <q>Parenthood</q> (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan's <q>I Love You to Death</q> (1990).
